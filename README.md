**NOTE:** If we cannot run your code following these requirements we will not be able to evaluate it.

## How to Run
Write here **DETAILED** intructions on how to run your code.\
**NOTE:** If we cannot run your code following these instructions we will not be able to evaluate it.

As an example here are the instructions to run the Dummy Project:
To run the Dummy project you have to:
- clone the repository;
- open a terminal instance and using the command ```cd``` move to the folder where the project has been downloaded;
- then run:

docker run -it --rm -p 5173:5173 my-webapp
```
Open a browser and connect to http://localhost:5173

**run bash in interactive container**
```bash
docker build -t my-webapp src/.

## Milestones
Document here the major milestones of your code and future planned steps.\
- [ ] Milestone 1
  - [ ] Completed Sub-task: ...
  - [ ] Completed Sub-task: ...

- [ ] Milestone 2
  - [ ] Sub-task: ...
  - [ ] Sub-task: ...

Create a list subtask.\
Open an issue for each subtask. Once you create a subtask, link the corresponding issue.\
Create a merge request (with corresponding branch) from each issue.\
Finally accept the merge request once issue is resolved. Once you complete a task, link the corresponding merge commit.\
Take a look at [Issues and Branches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSuSBuVYpys) for more details. 

This will help you have a clearer overview of what you are currently doing, track your progress and organise your work among yourselves. Moreover it gives us more insights on your progress.  

## Weekly Summary 
Write here a short summary with weekly progress, including challanges and open questions.\
We will use this to understand what your struggles and where did the weekly effort go to.

## Versioning
Create stable versions of your code each week by using gitlab tags.\
Take a look at [Gitlab Tags](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/tags.html) for more details. 

Then list here the weekly tags. \
We will evaluate your code every week, based on the corresponding version.
